*Building the network stack for scalable, distributed quantum computing.*

## 🚀 About Us

Qoro Quantum is developing the infrastructure for distributed quantum computing. Our platform enables seamless quantum-classical hybrid computing by optimizing resource allocation and synchronizing multi-vendor quantum clusters. 

## 🔬 Our Mission

We aim to build a scalable, cloud-based quantum computing network that connects and orchestrates quantum and classical resources efficiently. Our work spans:

- **Quantum Datacenter Networks**
- **Quantum-Classical Hybrid Applications**
- **Routing & Switching in Distributed Quantum Networks**

## 🌍 What We Do

We develop:

- **Quantum Resource Management Systems** – Automating job scheduling across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and QPUs.
- **Network Control Protocols** – Synchronizing multi-vendor quantum computing clusters.
- **Quantum Simulation Frameworks** – Simulating terrestrial and non-terrestrial quantum networks.

## 🤝 Collaborate With Us

We are actively looking for collaborators and partners to drive the next era of quantum computing. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or company interested in quantum networking, let’s connect!
