# Qoro Quantum

Building the software stack for scalable, distributed quantum computing.

## 🚀 About Us

Qoro Quantum develops software infrastructure for running quantum workloads across heterogeneous and distributed computing environments. Our platform connects classical HPC resources, simulators, and quantum hardware into a unified execution layer, enabling practical quantum-classical hybrid computing today.

We focus on making quantum workflows scalable, hardware-aware, and deployable in real production environments such as HPC centers, cloud platforms, and emerging quantum data centers.

## 🧩 Core Projects

### Divi

Divi is Qoro’s Python SDK for quantum application developers. [Divi Repo](https://github.com/QoroQuantum/divi).

It enables users to:
- Define quantum algorithms once and execute them across simulators, HPC systems, and quantum hardware
- Parallelize and batch quantum workloads transparently
- Build hybrid quantum-classical workflows without manual backend management

Divi is designed for researchers, students, and enterprises who want to focus on algorithms rather than infrastructure.

### Maestro

Maestro is Qoro’s simulation and execution layer. [Maestro Repo](https://github.com/QoroQuantum/maestro).

It provides:
- A unified interface to multiple quantum circuit simulation backends
- Automatic backend selection based on circuit structure, scale, and available hardware
- Support for CPU, GPU, and, soon, distributed simulation techniques used in HPC environments

Maestro is used both as a high-performance simulator and as a decision layer that informs scheduling and orchestration in distributed quantum systems.

## 🔬 Our Mission

We aim to enable distributed quantum computing at scale by treating quantum devices, simulators, and classical resources as jointly schedulable networked components.

Our work spans:
- Quantum datacenter and cluster networking
- Quantum-classical hybrid applications
- Resource-aware scheduling, routing, and execution
- Integration of quantum computing into HPC and cloud environments

## 🤝 Collaborate With Us

We actively collaborate with HPC centers, research institutions, and industry partners working on quantum computing, simulation, and hybrid workflows.

If you are interested in joint research, pilot projects, or integrating quantum capabilities into existing infrastructure, we would be happy to connect.
